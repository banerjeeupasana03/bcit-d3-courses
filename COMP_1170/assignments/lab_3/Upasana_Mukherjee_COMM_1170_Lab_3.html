      The Poems I love to Read
    </h1>
    <p>
      Literature offers us a vast array of poetry. There are some that touches our heart, some that makes us love, some that makes us cry and some that makes us believe. There have been great poets in English Literature from time to time, however I have selected three of the poets from three generations of poetry. They are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="odd"><a href="#william_shakespeare"><b>William Shakespeare</b></a></li>
      <li class="even"><a href="#john_keats"><b>John Keats</b></a></li>
      <li class="odd"><a href="#t_s_eliot"><b>T.S Eliot</b></a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3><u> Few Words about the poets I have chosen</u></h3>
    <ol>
      <li class="odd">
        <p>
          <b><u>William Shakespeare:</u></b>
          <span class="highlight">William Shakespeare</span> was an English poet, playwright and actor, widely regarded as both the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the<span class="highlight"> Bard of Avon</span>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="even">
        <p>
          <b><u>John Keats:</u></b>
          <span class="highlight">John Keats was an English Romantic poet</span>. He was one of the main figures of the second generation of Romantic poets, along with Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley, despite his works having been in publication for only four years before his death from tuberculosis at the age of 25

      <li class="odd">
        <p>
          <b><u>T.S. Eliot:</u></b>
          Certainly the most imposing poet of his time, <span class="highlight">Eliot was revered by Igor Stravinsky <i>"not only as a great sorcerer of words but as the very key keeper of the language."</i></span> His poems in many respects articulated the disillusionment of a younger post–World War I generation with the values and conventions—both literary and social—of the Victorian era

        <td>Sonnet no. 116</td>
        <td>William Shakespeare</td>
        <td>This sonnet attempts to define love, by telling both what it is and is not. In the first quatrain, the speaker says that love—”the marriage of true minds”—is perfect and unchanging; it does not “admit impediments,” and it does not change when it find changes in the loved one. In the second quatrain, the speaker tells what love is through a metaphor: a guiding star to lost ships (“wand’ring barks”) that is not susceptible to storms (it “looks on tempests and is never shaken”). In the third quatrain, the speaker again describes what love is not: it is not susceptible to time. Though beauty fades in time as rosy lips and cheeks come within “his bending sickle’s compass,” love does not change with hours and weeks: instead, it “bears it out ev’n to the edge of doom.” In the couplet, the speaker attests to his certainty that love is as he says: if his statements can be proved to be error, he declares, he must never have written a word, and no man can ever have been in love.</td>

      <tr class="even" id="john_keats">
        <td>Ode to the Nightangle</td>
        <td>John Keats</td>
        <td>The nightingale described within the poem experiences a type of death but does not actually die. Instead, the songbird is capable of living through its song, which is a fate that humans cannot expect. The poem ends with an acceptance that pleasure cannot last and that death is an inevitable part of life. In the poem, Keats imagines the loss of the physical world and sees himself dead—as a "sod" over which the nightingale sings. The contrast between the immortal nightingale and mortal man sitting in his garden, is made all the more acute by an effort of the imagination</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="odd" id="t_s_eliot">
        <td>The Wasteland</td>
        <td> T.S. Eliot</td>
        <td>The poem's structure is divided into five sections. The first section, "The Burial of the Dead," introduces the diverse themes of disillusionment and despair. The second, "A Game of Chess," employs vignettes of several characters—alternating narrations—that address those themes experientially. "The Fire Sermon," the third section, offers a philosophical meditation in relation to the imagery of death and views of self-denial in juxtaposition influenced by Augustine of Hippo and eastern religions. After a fourth section, "Death by Water," which includes a brief lyrical petition, the culminating fifth section, "What the Thunder Said," concludes with an image of judgment.

      I think there are a vast array of poems that I can talk about. I cannot but select one among them that I would love to read. It is a constant discovery of oneself and one's thoughts, a defamiliarisation of our individual selves. I think that in the journey of reading poems, we endeavour in a journey of self-discovery. That is the reason that poems never grow old.
